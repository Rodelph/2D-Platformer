Please download the DLLs of the SFML api that you can find by clicking on this link : https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ .

I did not test the project with MinGW (sorry) !!

You can download the latest zip "Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 64-bit" and in the directory " SFML-2.5.1/bin " please copy the following DLLs :

- openal32.dll
- sfml-audio-2.dll

Please build your project in release mode, and then put the DLL files (mentionned above) in the " x64/Release " folder right next to the .exe file of the project.
